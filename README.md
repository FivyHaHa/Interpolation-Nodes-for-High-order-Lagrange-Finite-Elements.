Directories: tet, pyramid

tet: TBA

pyramid: run and edit "test.m" for routines generating nodes. Fekete and "approximate Fekete" nodes are also available as .mat files in /pyramid/precomputedNodes/.

The above codes are built on the MATLAB codes from "Nodal Discontinuous Galerkin Methods: Algorithms, Analysis, and Applications", Jan S Hesthaven and Tim Warburton.  

All codes were run with Matlab R2010a, version 7.10.0.499.
